#   Localization

Localization is the process of adapting a website into different linguistic and cultural contexts - involving much more than the simple translation of text.

Syncfusion Report Server is released with localization support.

The default language is English “en-US”.

Read the below documentation on How to add new localizations and How to edit existing localizations in the Report Server.
